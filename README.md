## Usage

To view this app, [visit the deployment on Netlify](https://quiet-truffle-7e3cbe.netlify.app/) and use the buttons to navigate between pages of the site. Note that the header and footer elements are fixed components, and the buttons occupying them are used to render various pages to the main body of the page, as can be seen by observing the change in the site URL.
